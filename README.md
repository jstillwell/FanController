# FanController
Fan controller using Arduino and L298N

I had these laying around and built a new PC that I wanted a controller for. What is the only thing better than buying one? Making it yourself. The idea here is to have the L298N power the fans and the arduino(through the Vin pin). There are 4 pins on the L298N for output but they are meant to control the polarity of the motors so we can only use 2 (one from eash side). 

I have tried to make a library for abstracting some of this away but my cpp is not too strong yet.

I would love to hear from you if you are interested in the project.
